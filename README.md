# ATM-Login-page
This Java program creates a login GUI for a Bank Management System using Swing. The Login class extends JFrame and uses ActionListener to manage button actions. It includes fields for card number and PIN, with "SIGN IN..", "CLEAR..", and "SIGN UP.." buttons. The design features images and a fixed 850x480 layout. Minor typos can be easily fixed.
